## Overview

Intended to support graduate-level students to be able to apply data
science methods to topics of teaching, learning, and educational
systems. Introduces students to the data science software and
programming language R. Course activities focusing on preparing, using,
and visualizing complex data sources for analysis using the tidyverse
suite of R packages. Data ethics are foregrounded. Includes an
introduction to text analysis/Natural Language Processing. No
pre-requisites or programming experience is required.

## Major Topics

-   The course will provide students with a foundation in data science
    in education, defined as those that integrate computation with
    statistics and substantive expertise. Also, the course will include
    opportunities for students to gain experience with specific data
    science techniques that may be widely used across research projects.

-   Students will have the opportunity to bring their own data from
    their research projects for use in this class. In this way, they
    will have immediate application for the concepts learned in the
    course. Bringing in one's own data will be highly encouraged, as the
    work done in this class could serve as the foundation of a future
    conference proposal or publication for the student. If no data is
    immediately available from the student's research, students can use
    one of hundreds of freely available datasets to complete coursework
    or students can use datasets provided to them.

-   My goal in teaching this course will be to catalyze students'
    interest in data science and to bolster their confidence in their
    abilities to use programming techniques to support their research
    programs. Many people who try to self-teach become overwhelmed by
    available resources. This course will provide scaffolding to help
    students become proficient in a few sophisticated data science
    techniques, and it will give students enough foundational knowledge
    to pick up new data science skills on their own after the course is
    through.

## Learning Objectives:

The objectives for the proposed course are for students to be able to:

Install, set up, and use R and RStudio Use reproducible workflows (so
that analyses can easily be modified and then carried out again by the
analyst or others) with R Markdown Prepare and explore complex data
sources for analysis using the tidyverse suite of R packages Understand
how issues of equity, privacy, and ethics are central to data science in
education Develop a personal learning and development plan related to
data science in education Develop a portfolio of work from this class
that you can add to later Pursue an independent project to work toward a
relevant professional goal

These objectives will serve as a foundation for later data science in
education-related courses, including data visualization, creating
interactive web applications, and machine learning applications.

## Format and Learning Environment

This class will be taught in a fully-online format. We will use Zoom for
synchronous (or at-the-same-time) a) introductions to new content, b)
"try-it-out" laboratories, and c) discussions. We will also use a number
of tools for asynchronous communication, including a) Slack, b) GitHub,
and c) features of the Canvas course learning management system. Course
Communications: Slack Slack is a communication platform designed for
teams (e.g., in a company), that has begun to be used in education. We
will use Slack to share resources and for asking and questions of one
another. You are encouraged but not required to check Slack daily, and
to use the app on your mobile device or phone. Email If you email us,
you will generally receive a response within 24 hours. We ask for you to
please try to respond within 24 hours, too. You can contact us via email
(above) or Slack (preferred). How to Be Successful in This Course:

Don't hesitate to ask questions! Learning to do data science is
challenging for everyone, and reaching out for support and assistance is
imperative. My late assignment policy is that as long as you submit the
assignment before we grade it, you will receive full credit. However, we
may grade assignments very soon after they are due. For assignments
received after the due date, 5% from the grade you otherwise would earn
will be subtracted from your final grade for each day late.

## Required Equipment:

You will need a computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux are fine!) on which you
can install applications, but you do not need a computer with any
particular specifications (speed, storage, etc.) beyond what you use for
other courses: whatever you have will work for this course.

## Learning Activities

-   **In-class discussions and activities.** There will be weekly
    readings that focus on the theory and principles of data
    visualization. We will engage with these readings through
    discussions and other in-class activities and apply the knowledge
    gained to our visualization work.

-   **In-class programming.** At the core of this class is programming
    in R. We will develop R programming skills for data wrangling,
    exploration, and visualization together by doing various in-class
    programming activities. We will complete these activities as a whole
    class, in small groups, or in pairs. Semi-structured activities will
    give us a chance to discuss, better understand, and practice our
    programming skills.

-   **Weekly visualization assignments**: Weekly tasks that involve
    combining reading about relevant theory and prior research, working
    through fundamentals in a guided practice model, and creating
    visualizations based on the relevant theory and prior research and
    fundamental skills. These will be submitted as R documents, HTML
    files, or images.Â 

-   **Mini project 1:** This independent project will involve the
    application of theory and programming to create various
    visualizations from an already-existing data set. Your work will be
    shared with other students and the instructor to provide you with
    opportunities to provide and receive constructive critique (and to
    revise your work, as is the case with all visualizations!).

-   **Data ethics statement:** You will explore visualizations created
    by others for #tidytuesday and apply newly learned skills together
    with the theory and programming learned in class to a provided data
    set to create various visualizations from a provided data set. Your
    work will be shared with other students and the instructor to
    provide you with opportunities to provide and receive constructive
    critique and revise your work.

-   **Resource sharing:** xx

-   **Final project:** You will complete a final project that involves
    developing visualizations for your own data or a data set of your
    choice. The goal of this project is to create a publication-ready
    visualization that demonstrates what you have learned throughout the
    course.
