Please don’t hesitate to email us or contact us on Slack with updates, questions or concerns. We will try to respond within 24 hours during the week and 48 hours on the weekend. We will notify you if our response may be delayed. In short, please contact us.
Major Topics:

The course will provide students with a foundation in data science in education, defined as those that integrate computation with statistics and substantive expertise. Also, the course will include opportunities for students to gain experience with specific data science techniques that may be widely used across research projects.
Students will have the opportunity to bring their own data from their research projects for use in this class. In this way, they will have immediate application for the concepts learned in the course. Bringing in one’s own data will be highly encouraged, as the work done in this class could serve as the foundation of a future conference proposal or publication for the student. If no data is immediately available from the student’s research, students can use one of hundreds of freely available datasets to complete coursework or students can use datasets provided to them.
My goal in teaching this course will be to catalyze students’ interest in data science and to bolster their confidence in their abilities to use programming techniques to support their research programs. Many people who try to self-teach become overwhelmed by available resources. This course will provide scaffolding to help students become proficient in a few sophisticated data science techniques, and it will give students enough foundational knowledge to pick up new data science skills on their own after the course is through.
Student Learning Objectives:

The objectives for the proposed course are for students to be able to:

Install, set up, and use R and RStudio
Use reproducible workflows (so that analyses can easily be modified and then carried out again by the analyst or others) with R Markdown
Prepare and explore complex data sources for analysis using the tidyverse suite of R packages
Understand how issues of equity, privacy, and ethics are central to data science in education
Develop a personal learning and development plan related to data science in education
Develop a portfolio of work from this class that you can add to later
Pursue an independent project to work toward a relevant professional goal

These objectives will serve as a foundation for later data science in education-related courses, including data visualization, creating interactive web applications, and machine learning applications.
Learning Environment: 

This class will be taught in a fully-online format. We will use Zoom for synchronous (or at-the-same-time) a) introductions to new content, b) “try-it-out” laboratories, and c) discussions. We will also use a number of tools for asynchronous communication, including a) Slack, b) GitHub, and c) features of the Canvas course learning management system.
Course Communications:
Slack
Slack is a communication platform designed for teams (e.g., in a company), that has begun to be used in education. We will use Slack to share resources and for asking and questions of one another. You are encouraged but not required to check Slack daily, and to use the app on your mobile device or phone. 
Email
If you email us, you will generally receive a response within 24 hours. We ask for you to please try to respond within 24 hours, too. You can contact us via email (above) or Slack (preferred).
How to Be Successful in This Course:


Don’t hesitate to ask questions! Learning to do data science is challenging for everyone, and reaching out for support and assistance is imperative.
My late assignment policy is that as long as you submit the assignment before we grade it, you will receive full credit. However, we may grade assignments very soon after they are due. For assignments received after the due date, 5% from the grade you otherwise would earn will be subtracted from your final grade for each day late.
Texts/Resources/Materials:

Estrellado, R. A., Freer, E. A., Mostipak, J., Rosenberg, J. M., & Velásquez, I. C. (2020). Data science in education using R. London, England: Routledge. Freely-available from: http://www.datascienceineducation.com/
Required Equipment:

You will need a computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux are fine!) on which you can install applications, but you do not need a computer with any particular specifications (speed, storage, etc.) beyond what you use for other courses: whatever you have will work for this course.
Learning Activities: 

Complete exercises each week 
Four interactive examinations
Write a personal statement on one’s perspective toward the role and nature of data, addressing how issues of equity, privacy, and ethics are central to data science in education (due approximately one-third of the way through the semester).
Develop a personal learning and development plan related to data science in education Complete an individually-designed project that can take different forms (R Markdown Report, interactive Shiny app, interactive dashboard, etc.) related to identifying and solving a data-related problem in education using R (due approximately two-thirds of the way through the semester).
Develop a portfolio with your work from throughout the semester. 
Complete an individually-designed project that can take different forms (R Markdown Report, interactive Shiny app, interactive dashboard, etc.) related to identifying and solving a data-related problem in education using R (due as a final exam at the end of the semester, with updates on progress made due throughout the semester).

University Policies:
Academic Integrity:

“An essential feature of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville is a commitment to maintaining an atmosphere of intellectual integrity and academic honesty. As a student of the university, I pledge that I will neither knowingly give nor receive any inappropriate assistance in academic work, thus affirming my own personal commitment to honor and integrity.”
University Civility Statement:

Civility is genuine respect and regard for others: politeness, consideration, tact, good manners, graciousness, cordiality, affability, amiability and courteousness. Civility enhances academic freedom and integrity, and is a prerequisite to the free exchange of ideas and knowledge in the learning community. Our community consists of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and campus visitors. Community members affect each other’s well-being and have a shared interest in creating and sustaining an environment where all community members and their points of view are valued and respected. Affirming the value of each member of the university community, the campus asks that all its members adhere to the principles of civility and community adopted by the campus: http://civility.utk.edu/.
