# Purpose and Agenda

What do you need to be able to work with a range of datasets? This week focuses on core data wrangling skills; it is the first of four weeks that equip you with a set of skills focused on the dplyr and tidyr packages that are part of the tidyverse. The context is accessing and preparing data on colleges in advance of building a better rating system.

## What we'll do in this presentation

- Discussion
- Reading Recap
- Key Concept: select, rename, filter, arrange
- Key Concept: Ratings and rankings
- Code-along and data
- What's next: Assignment(s) and Readings

# Discussion

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Background]

- APIs can be very powerful, affording access to large data sets in a convenient manner
- However, they can occasionally be difficult to use to due: a) technical issues, b) challenges around the size or amount of the data being accessed, c) the degree of documentation, among others. 

]

.panel[.panel-name[Discussion Question]

- What issues, if any, did you encounter in the last week using the Education Data Portal API via the educationdata R package? How did you overcome them---or try to overcome them?
- What went well in the last week?

# Key Concept: Ratings and rankings

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[educationdata]

- Reminder: The [educationdata R package](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/education-data-package-r/index.html) facilitates access to the [Education Data Portal's API](https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/index.html)

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
df <- get_education_data(level = "schools",
                         source = "ccd",
                         topic = "enrollment",
                         filters = list(year = 2021, grade = 12))
```

*Documentation:*

1. The [R package documentation](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/education-data-package-r/articles/introducing-educationdata.html)
2. The [EDP API documentation](https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/index.html)
]

.panel[.panel-name[Variables]

- Any data on *colleges*: https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/colleges.html
- These four sources available via educationdata are likely to be particularly helpful:
    - IPEDS
    - College Scorecard
    - Federal Student Aid
    - National Association of College and University Business Officers
    
- 
]

.panel[.panel-name[Ranking]

- Creating a ranking involves 1) _accessing data_, 2) _preparing_ different variables, 3) _combining_ them into a single score or rank and 4) _interpreting_ the output
- This will likely involve several dplyr functions:
    - `mutate()`
    - `row_number()`
    - `scale()`
    - `arrange()`

]

.panel[.panel-name[Process]

- Week 7, *this week*: Access and standardize data
- Week 8, *next week (fall break)*: Combine data and present and interpret rankings

# Code-along

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[1. Accessing]

- Tuition and fees and fall retention rates
- We'll have to access data on each, standardize them, and combine them to create a ranking

- Let's access the data

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(educationdata)
library(tidyverse)

ratio <- get_education_data(level = "college-university",
    source = "ipeds",
    topic = "student-faculty-ratio",
    filters = list(year = 2020))

retention <- get_education_data(level = "college-university",
    source = "ipeds",
    topic = "fall-retention",
    filters = list(year = 2020))
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[2. Preparing]

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ratio <- as_tibble(ratio)

ratio <- ratio %>% 
    select(unitid, student_faculty_ratio) # to simply the data

```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
retention <- as_tibble(retention)

retention <- retention %>% 
    filter(ftpt == 99) %>% # let's look at the total of both full (1) and part-time (2) students
    select(unitid, retention_rate) # to simply the data
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[3. Combining]

- As the variables are on different scales, calculating _ranks_ may be helpful -- `min_rank()`, which assigns tied ranks to equivalent values

```{r}
x <- c(5, 1, 3, 2, 2, NA)
min_rank(x)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
combined_data <- inner_join(ratio, retention, by = c("unitid"))

combined_data <- combined_data %>% 
    mutate(student_faculty_ratio_rank = min_rank(student_faculty_ratio),
           retention_rate_rank = min_rank(retention_rate)) %>% 
    select(unitid, student_faculty_ratio_rank, retention_rate_rank)

final_ranks <- combined_data %>% 
    mutate(total_rank = (student_faculty_ratio_rank + retention_rate_rank) / 2) %>% 
    arrange(total_rank)

final_ranks
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[4. Interpreting]

- We need to know the names of the institutions to be able to present and interpret our results.
- We can access that data, too

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
directory <- get_education_data(level = "college-university",
    source = "ipeds",
    topic = "directory",
    filters = list(year = 2020))

directory <- directory %>% 
    select(unitid, inst_name)

final_ranks %>% 
    left_join(directory) %>% 
    select(inst_name, total_rank)
```

]

# What's next?

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Weekly Assignment]

- In the weekly assignment, you will expand on what we did in the code-along in several ways:
    - Researching how _other ranking systems_ work
    - Planning out your approach_
    - Adding at least three _other_ variables (more is fine!)
    - Considering the _size_ or _type_ of school in your analysis
    - Suggesting possible improvements in the context of your interpretation of your results

]

.panel[.panel-name[Data]

- We'll again be using data from the educationdata package --- any of the college-related data: https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/colleges.html#ipeds_directory
- Again, these four sources available via educationdata are likely to be particularly helpful:
    - IPEDS
    - College Scorecard
    - Federal Student Aid
    - National Association of College and University Business Officers
