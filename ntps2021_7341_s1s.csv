1 Includes both part-time and full-time nurses. Estimates are rounded to the nearest 10.,NA,NA,NA
NOTE: FTE is full-time equivalent. The number of FTE nurses is calculated by summing the number of full-time nurses and half the number of part-time nurses. This may be an overestimate of the number of FTEs and an underestimate of the number of students per FTE nurse if part-time school nurses typically work less than half time. Data are weighted estimates of the population.,NA,NA,NA
